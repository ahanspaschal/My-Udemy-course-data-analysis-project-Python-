## This is python data analysis project. On this project, I will be working with a real dataset from Udemy. This dataset contains details about Udemy courses such as; their prices, number of subscribers, content duration and so on. The aim of this project is to analyze this data, uncover insights and make good recommendations on how to boost revenue generation through increased number of subscribers and course sales based on the findings. Some of the insights I will be working to uncover from this datset includes:

1) The total numbers of subscribers in each subject?

2) How many courses are free and paid for each subject?

3) How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?

4) What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?

5) What are the 20 most popular courses? Also, include the following information:

a) Their level
b) Whether they are free or paid
c) Whether any are free beginner courses, and the duration of the courses.

6) Does content duration impact the price of the course?

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1) After carefully analyzing the dataset, it was observed that about 68% of total subscribers in udemy went for web development courses. And also the top five most subscribed courses are web development courses.
2) It was also observed that on average, web development courses are the most expensive, and has the longest content duration.
3) On a closer look, it was observed that on average, musical instrument courses are the cheapest, have the shortest duration of content, but still has the least number of subscribers.
4) It can be confirmed that content duration have no impact on the price of course, as well as the number of subscibers.
5) Subscribers are willing to pay higher and spend longer time on a course. What matters most id their choice of interest.
