## This is python data analysis project. I will be working with a real dataset from Udemy. This dataset contains details about Udemy courses, such as their prices, number of subscribers, content duration and so on. So the aim is to analyze this data and cover insights inorder to make a good recommendation to the udemy management team on how to boost revennue generation through increased number of subscribers and course sales. Some of the insights I will be working to uncover from this datset includes:

1) What are the total numbers of subscribers in each subject?

2) How many courses are free and paid for each subject?

3) How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?

4) What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?

5) What are the 20 most popular courses? Also, include the following information:

Their level
Whether they are free or paid
Whether any are free beginner courses,
and the duration of the courses.
6) Does content duration impact the price of the course?
